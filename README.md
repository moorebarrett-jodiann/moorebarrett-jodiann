## About me ðŸ˜„

Name: Jodi-Ann Moore-Barrett

I am a Software Developer born and raised in Kingston, Jamaica, currently based in Winnipeg, Canada.

A passionate IT professional with a keen eye for detail and a fast, lifelong learner. I enjoy watching a wide varity of movies and documentaries and crossroad trips to enjoy the beautiful scenery of nature and life.

In my IT career of over 7 years, I have held roles in Software Development and DevOps.

My programming experience includes C, C++, JavaScript, PHP and JQuery, and my DevOps experience spans technologies such as Microsoft Azure, 
Kubernetes, and Linux Servers. I also have experience in application support and troubleshooting.

I'm currently pursuing a full-time Software Development Post-Grad Diploma at the Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology in Winnipeg, Canada with the aim of ultimately landing a Senior Full-Stack Developer position at a great company.

Get in touch. I look forward to hearing from you!
